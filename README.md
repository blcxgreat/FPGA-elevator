# FPGA-elevator
Final project for intro to digital circuits and systems

Coded in 2018 by Chunguang(Eric) Xie

This is an elevator design aiming for simulating a real elevator using FPGA and seven segment diaplay.
The program handled with metastability, elevator direction problems, as well as user input problems.

Hardware used: FPGA
